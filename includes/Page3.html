    <center><font face="Helvetica" color="FireBrick" size="6">My least favorite expansion pack of all time: </font></center><br>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="LightSeaGreen" size="5">My least favorite pack is Island Living. This pack comes with many additions, but very specific gameplay is required in order to get the most out of this pack.</font></p>
    <font face="Trebuchet MS" color="SlateBlue" size="3">This pack comes with the ability to have a Sim become a mermaid! Your Sim can also go to the beach, sunbathe, and sand comb. These features are great, but after playing with the pack a few times the gameplay can turn dull. </font><br>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="LightCoral" size="4">BUGS BUGS BUGS. Many Simmers have experienced a permanent bug after buying this DLC. Due to this pack's world being inspired by the Pacific Islands, the townies that come with the world have names that originate from the Pacific Islands. This is great, but somehow these new names bugged the random name generator. This bug results in a large percentage of NPCs having names that come from this pack.</font></p>
